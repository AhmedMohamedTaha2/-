
The given code is a JavaScript code that implements a product management system. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

- It selects various elements from the HTML document using document.querySelectorAll and assigns them to variables.
- It checks if there are any products stored in the local storage and retrieves them if they exist.
- It defines a getTotal function that calculates the total price of a product based on the price, tax, and discount values.
- It adds event listeners to the input elements (except the first and last) to trigger the getTotal function when the user types.
- It defines a clearInputs function that clears the values of the input elements.
- It adds a click event listener to the window to handle the display of a layer element when clicking outside the layer or any input element.
- It defines a createOrUpdateProduct function that creates or updates a product based on the values entered by the user.
- Inside the function, it checks if the user is creating a new product and if any input is empty. If so, it displays a layer element.
- It creates a new product object with the entered values and adds it to the Products array.
- It updates the Products array if the user is updating an existing product.
- It calls the clearInputs function, calls the DisplayProducts function to update the displayed table of products, and saves the Products array in the local storage.
- It defines a DisplayProducts function that generates an HTML table based on the products in the Products array.
- It defines deleteProduct and updateProduct functions that handle the deletion and updating of a specific product, respectively.
- It sets up event listeners for the delete and edit buttons in each row of the table to call the corresponding functions.
- It defines a mainFunction that is called when the main button is clicked.
- Inside the mainFunction, it checks if any input is empty and sets the isAnyInputEmpty flag accordingly.
- It calls the createOrUpdateProduct function.
- Overall, the code provides functionality to add, edit, and delete products, calculates the total price based on tax and discount, and stores the products in the local storage. The DisplayProducts function updates the table whenever there are changes to the products.
